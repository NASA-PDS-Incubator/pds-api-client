# üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è GitHub Workflows

Please note that no workflows are defined for this repository. Because

-   The code is generated using the OpenAPI code generator; and
    -   The code generator is a moving target with
        -   Buggy interim releases; and
        -   Capricious name-changes of generated artifacts
-   The Swagger API definitions are manually updated in this repository; because
    -   There is not a relialbe URL from which the API definitions can be retrieved

there is not yet a clean way to automatically produce releases of this sofware. See the `docs/source/developer/index.rst` file for more information.
